just a guy who loves building cool shit

- i mostly mess around with typescript and rust
- i play [the finals](https://reachthefinals.com) a lot and think too much about [attack on titan](https://google.com/search?q=attack+on+titan&oq=attack+on+titan)
- sometimes i draw or animate
- i'm always open to collaborate or just talk about whatever
