just a guy who loves making stuff

- i use typescript for everything and godot for games
- sometimes i draw or animate
- [aot](https://google.com/search?q=attack+on+titan&oq=attack+on+titan) is a masterpiece btw
- favorite game [the finals](https://reachthefinals.com)
- i don't bother pushing projects to github if they're just a web app or something simple
